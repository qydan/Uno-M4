Uno Flip Game created for the class project for the Carleton University SYSC3110 Fall 2025.

## Contributions

**Group Members:**
* Ajan Balaganesh
* Danilo Bukvic
* Aydan Eng
* Aws Ali

### Individual Breakdown

* **Ajan Balaganesh:**
    * Contributed to the core `UnoModel` logic, specifically managing turn progression and state updates.
    * Assisted in implementing the `UnoView` interface and integrating it with the main frame logic.
    * Wrote unit tests for `UnoCardTest` to verify card matching logic.

* **Danilo Bukvic:**
    * Implemented the **Uno Flip** mechanics, including the `isDark` state toggling and the dual-sided `UnoCard` logic.
    * Developed the `UnoController` to handle user input and bridge the Model and View.
    * Refined the Javadoc documentation across the project.

* **Aydan Eng:**
    * Implemented the **AI Player** logic in `UnoModel`, specifically the strategy for prioritizing action cards.
    * Created the `UnoAiTest` suite to verify computer opponent behavior.
    * Worked on the GUI layout in `UnoFrame` to ensure correct updates during game loops.

* **Aws Ali:**
    * Designed the `UnoEvent` class to ensure safe data transfer between Model and View.
    * Implemented the specific card effects (Draw 5, Skip Everyone, Wild Draw Color) in the Model.
    * Wrote `UnoControllerTest` and `UnoModelTest` to ensure robust error handling.

## Changelog

### Milestone 4 (Version 4.0)

#### Added
- **Undo/Redo System:** Implemented a history stack system using serialization to snapshot game states, allowing players to undo moves and redo them.
- **Serialization (Save/Load):** Added functionality to save the current game state to a file (`.ser`) and load it back later to resume play.
- **Scoring & Rounds:** Implemented official scoring rules. When a player empties their hand, the round ends, and points are tallied based on opponents' remaining cards. The game continues in rounds until a player reaches 500 points.
- **GUI Menu Bar:** Added a `JMenuBar` to the main frame containing "File" (Save, Load) and "Game" (Undo, Redo) options.
- **JUnit Tests:** Added `UnoMilestone4Test` to verify serialization persistence and undo/redo logic.

#### Changed
- Updated `UnoModel`, `UnoPlayer`, and `UnoCard` to implement `Serializable`.
- Refactored `UnoView` interface to include `handleRoundEnd` for intermediate round summaries.
- Updated `UnoController` to handle `SAVE`, `LOAD`, `UNDO`, and `REDO` commands.

### Milestone 3 (Version 3.0)

#### Added
- Full Uno Flip special card functionality:
    - Flip Card (switch all cards between Light and Dark sides)
    - Draw Five (next player draws 5 cards and loses their turn)
    - Skip Everyone (all opponents skipped, current player goes again)
    - Wild Draw Colour (player selects new dark colour; next player draws until matching colour)
- Dual-sided Light/Dark card system and Flip mechanic for the deck and discard pile
- Updated scoring rules for Uno Flip cards
- AI Player system supporting 2–4 players, with selection between Human or AI
- AI legal-move validation and basic strategy for selecting playable cards
- JUnit tests for:
    - Uno Flip special cards
    - AI player behaviour and strategy
- Updated UML class diagrams including new card types, AIPlayer, and dual-side card logic
- New sequence diagrams:
    - Human player plays a Flip Card
    - AI Player selects and plays a move
- README updates explaining AI strategy, special cards, and milestone-specific features

#### AI Strategy
The AI Player implementation uses a priority-based strategy rather than random selection to provide a competitive experience. When it is the AI's turn, it evaluates its hand against the current top card and active side (Light/Dark):
1.  **Win Condition:** If the AI has one card left and it matches, it plays it immediately.
2.  **Aggression (Action Cards):** The AI prioritizes playing Action cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Five, Flip, etc.) to disrupt the next player's turn.
3.  **Standard Play:** If no action cards are valid, it plays a matching number or color card.
4.  **Wild Cards:** Wild cards are saved for last resort to ensure the AI always has a playable option if colors change.
5.  **Draw:** If no legal move is available, the AI draws a card.

#### Changed
- Updated internal data structures to support Light/Dark card states and Flip behavior
- Modified game loop and turn-handling logic to incorporate AI players and new special card effects
- Improved deck/discard logic to support flipping between sides
- Updated documentation to match new system architecture and gameplay rules
